# Strava Training Analysis
Strava is a social network of endurance athletes to connect, track and share progression in their fitness. I use the application to log my activities for training analysis and personal performance.

The purpose of this project was to explore my year in training using the Strava API to analyze the time I dedicated to training for the year for all of my logged runs, bikes and swims.
